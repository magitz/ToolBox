#  Takes input of list of NCBI record IDs to fetch. 
#  Downloads these records and parses the CDSs out, putting
#  them into fasta files named by the annotations.

#
# Version 1.3: 9/29/23
#   -Update prints for python3
# Version 1.2: 2/10/16
#   -Added option to include a certain number of base pairs upstream and downstream of the annotated gene.
#       Note that in this may include other annotated regions.
# Version 1.1: 1/5/15
#	-Added handling of multiple sequences with the same annotation.
#		By default genes with the same name in a sample will have a _copy_# added to everything after the 1st copy.
#		Set to 1 to exclude subsequent copies from the results files. Only the first is reported.
#	-Added testing for different cases of gene names. Uses the first one
#		for all subsequent samples, so pick the first sample carefully.
#		e.g. if the first sample has ccmFC and others have ccmFc, they will
#		be added to the ccmFC file.
